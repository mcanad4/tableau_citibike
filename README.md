<H1> CitiBike Observation <H1>

<H2> Gender Observations <H2>
# H3 Users of CitiBike are overwhelmingly female with over 2x the number of users in 2020 as males.  When diggin deeper and looking at gender and age; ridership peaks with the 30 year old group and then declines as age increases.  This pattern holds for both male and female users.  Taking this one step further, we looked at the time of day that bikes are rented and the duration of the trip.  Not only do females use the bike more often , the average duration of trip is also longer.  Trip duration time peaks with start time at 3PM (15) for both male and female.

# H2 User Type Observations
# H3 Majority of the customers that use CitiBike are subscribers.  Marketing dollars spent on acquisition should show the benefits of becoming a subscriber.  Majority of the subscribers are in the 30-40 age bucket; while the average non-subscriber (customer) is 50-60.  Potential for split marketing campaign targted younger for subsribers and older for more single time use.  Customer (non-subscriber) peaks in the evening (5-6pm); while subscribers peak at 8AM and then again between 5-6PM potentially aligning with work hours. 

# H2 Map Observations
# H3 Bike start locations are much more clustered around a few zip codes.  However, as bike are used they are returned a locations that are much more widespread.  This could indicate that more people ride the bikes home from work rather than into work.  Marketing campaigns could be used to target afternoon return from work trips and could potentially use an app to alert customers of abnormal traffic to encourage more use.
